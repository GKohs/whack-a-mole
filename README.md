# Whack a mole

It's a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org you can find here: https://youtu.be/lhNdUVh3qCc

1st commit is my code resulted in following the 'tutorial'.

Later commits or branches are my own attempts to upgrade the idea.

# Done
- prevent clicking the same 'mole' twice
- 'mole' disappears after hit

# Possibilities
- add strike counter for consecutive hits
- change speed of interval with higher consecutive hits
- add bonus points for hits with higher speed
- replace alert with something better
- upgrade the look
- game menu?
- different size
- different amount of tiles
- random card picture (http://lorempixel.com/100/100/cats/) (creepy version with specific gifs? :D - https://giphy.com/explore/random)
